Five out of Five Stars and a Heart Rating

man, this show...
It has such realistic characters, such fleshed out characters and theyre written with such mature care, even the plot too is handled so well. You can tell the author cares so much about these characters by giving them so much respect (if that makes sense).

However, I do have some minor personal nitpicks about this show. Sometimes, realistic characters can be a little TOO uncomfortable, not in a "what theyre doing is so uncomfortable i cant watch", more like "this is lowkey disgusting/horrible" type of way, but not in a shock factor gross NSFW/violent type of way, just very human, personal, emotional, and dramatic. Btw this is only rated 13+, this is the most mature show Ive seen with that age rating. Its not graphic, vulgar, violent, or explicitly sexual. It just has so much grounded and realistic people and topics and things they go through.

But still, that did not take too much from the overall experience that I've had with gem of an anime!

Props to the director for doing such a great job putting such great subtle details here and there. Like how the actual bands behind the show would need to create songs to capture the vibe and sound of the fictional bands and the great iconic soundtracks. Their great sense of pacing and editing. The way voice lines are placed. Animation, visuals. And really giving attention to the amazing fashion taste that the manga author has provided, this is a very fashionably stylish anime, every main character will go through their wardrobe often.

NANA is truly a unique, one of a kind type of anime. Only here will you experience such realistic drama and tension, such realistic people and relationships. I call it "gossip anime" the same way how gossip irl will make you pay really close attention and contemplate too.
