### This takes time

Not that it is a long album or you need to be forced to listen to this album repeatedly, what I mean is it takes growth.
At least, that's what happened to me. 
When my curiosity piqued and listened to this for the first time it was a REAL snoozer, I was ready to skip every single track that did not put me to sleep. 
Then, something very personal happened to me, I never got to talk to a very dear friend again, and I couldn't put out and rant or explain just how much it hurts me, but this album felt it, it knows and is conveying that feeling of loss and shit. 
Best believe this hit much harder when I experienced a break up lmao. 
So, do you need something heartbreaking for this album to hit? Possibly so! 
But to those with experience with heartbreak, this speaks volumes. 
I love this!
