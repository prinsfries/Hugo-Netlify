## I Like to Review Art!

I really like art and its various forms of medium.
I like visual arts whether it's films in live action or animation, or 
paintings physical or digital

Music touches my soul and its many genres
Notable artists I listen to a lot are:
The Beatles, Tyler, The Creator, Lamp, Kendrick Lamar.
I dont cling to a single genre and I love exploring music!

I have a skill in video editing and its kinda a curse when I notice bad editing in films or MVs lol
It was also when I fell in love with films during the pandemic and editing funny videos
is when i realized I wanted to be a filmmaker or anything involved in arts
but I was already applied as a BSIT student in PUPBC so... womp womp

ever since then Ive just been watching and listening a lot
and Im kinda like a kid still looking at my dream from afar, just stuck in IT
