### Revolutionary

Before the references and samples get lost in translation thru time, the best time to listen to this album is always as soon as possible

Yk as a chronically online gen z ever since I was a kid, this album really encapsulates every brainrot crevice of the internet. 
Hearing 2021 tiktok audios/hits mashed with 2000s - 2010s hits, mashed with flop twitter, mashed with youtube poop, mashed with the most insane future bass you'll ever hear. 
The sound was so unique and just resonates with whoever relates. I wasn't surprised that this series is now a genre. 
Gotta be top 10 online creations ever
