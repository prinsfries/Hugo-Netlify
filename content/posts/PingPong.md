Five out of Five Stars and a Heart Rating

I'll use the term 'spiritual' not in a superstition way, but more of 'one's core' type of way.

In most sports anime, there's always the encapsulation of 'the spirit of the sport' shown through various perspectives and executions.

However, Ping Pong the Animation has got to be the most 'spiritual' sports anime that is out there.

It feels like there are more than 1 protagonists in this series as you see the story shifts its perspective constantly through character's sides and really shows you what each of their lives are, from backstories, current struggles, and their vision of their future. You see their spirit.

Not only that but it also does it interpersonally. Showing how each character affects their spirit for the sport negatively and positively. It really shines on the scriptwriting and the lines they give each other.

Every single battle maintains to be very technical with the rules and techniques, but very uniquely, every single match is also every player's ambition, passion, clashing on to each other in what feels like its not just a table tennis match anymore, but a fight of each other's spirits.

Best part is that, you continue to see a perspective of their spirits after they win or lose. There's multiple episodes where you see the perspective of the player after they won but also the perspective of the player they beat long after the game. You feel like you're growing with these people. It doesnt feel like a match based story, but rather you continue to be in both the perspective of triumph and loss of different players.


### TECHNICAL SIDE

The animation is SO GOOD HOLY SHIT. Rarely do you ever get an anime so well detailed in animation. The animation is well detailed and quickly shifts from realistic/smooth to exaggerated/bombastic. Not only that but some shots are in a fish eye perspective and you can only imagine how hard it is to animate that smoothly and consistently. The very loose art style also adds to the unique look to the anime as well as a seamless and efficient way to allow the animation style to be fluid.

The storyboarding is INSANE. Consistently doing those shots where the screen gets broken down into panels and shows different angles and views of what is happening. Its such a unique storyboard style but people seem to not mention it as much, but I think if this style is implemented in a live action its going to be more noticeable. Aforementioned fish eyes and various shots that just cannot be done in live action just makes this anime the perfect eye candy.

Music and sound is amazing too! The intro very much tells the story its about to tell. The soundtracks used in fights are so fitting. And the sound design is so good!


Too long; didnt read: just watch the f-ing show its perfect
