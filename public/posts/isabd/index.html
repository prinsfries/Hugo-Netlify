<p>Five out of Five Stars and a Heart Rating</p>
<h3 id="this-review-contains-spoilers-its-best-to-watch-the-movie-first">This review contains spoilers! Its best to watch the movie first!<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-review-contains-spoilers-its-best-to-watch-the-movie-first">#</a></h3>
<p>All my life, I have been a forgetful person.</p>
<p>I remember memories and would often tell them to people in a detailed story telling way.</p>
<p>The first time I watched this movie, I never really understood and/or connected with what was going on with it. However, as the years went by, I noticed that I&rsquo;ve been forgetting a lot of important memories from my life, failing to recall them even with others repeatedly telling more details of the memory. While I gain more important memories and learn more and more how many memories I have forgotten, it reminded me of this movie as it had been stuck to the back of my head. I decided to rewatch it and it hit me like a goddamn bulldozer.</p>
<p>Even though I am only 17, still very young, I have always thought that being forgetful has always been just a quirk to me, not supposing any type of dread. But I felt very related to everything that Bill experienced that relates to his condition (but not the worse parts). And it scared me. I never knew it presented my forgetfulness in such a realistic way.</p>
<p>It started to shake me into thinking that I might or will grow up to be in similarity to Bill&rsquo;s condition. The parts where his condition got even worse, I started to feel the dread more. The visual degradation of the people he once knew and loved. The continually stacking amounts of everyday life that Bill forgets every time. Filling in the gaps of distant memories so it seemed more complete. The scene with his mother where Bill got paranoid and asked him &ldquo;do you really think that I would ever hurt you?&rdquo; made me teary eyed, knowing in a later scene, that it is implied that her mother passed away, without Bill even wondering what was said to him, completely forgetting her. It all compounded heavily for me.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the movie, Bill died. The commentator that has been with him along his entire life denies his death, and says that Bill turned immortal. When I first watched the movie, I thought it was stupid, and they should&rsquo;ve just ended the movie before ruining it. But I missed the point completely.</p>
<p>For me, it was the immortalization of his soul onto the memories of the people that had met him, or have been with him closely, in this case the commentator. It reminded me that the people I love mutually will see me in the same light, that I am etched to them as someone who lives forever in their memories until they themselves pass away.</p>
<p>I am certain now that this movie is and will be a very important memory to my life. I have never felt so related, scared, yet comforted by a movie as much as this. Rewatching this movie has been a great experience, lesson, and realization and I can&rsquo;t help but to think that It&rsquo;s Such a Beautiful Day.</p>
<p>P.S. Also please tell me ways of how to improve my memory, I&rsquo;ll start practicing while I&rsquo;m still young</p>
